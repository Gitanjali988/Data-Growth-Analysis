# 📊 E-Commerce Data Growth Analysis using SQL

This repository contains my completed SQL-based case study. The goal of the project is to analyze customer behavior and lifetime value using an e-commerce orders dataset. All analysis is performed in **Google Colab** using **SQL syntax via `pandasql`** and `pandas`.

## 📌 Objectives

### ✅ Question 1: Cohort Retention Analysis
- Built a **monthly cohort table** showing retention from month 1–12
- Identified **resurrected customers** who returned after 2+ months of inactivity
- Constructed **quality retention analysis** by filtering out low-value users (< $50 total)
- Delivered business insights and win-back strategy recommendations

### ✅ Question 2: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) & Acquisition Efficiency
- Segmented users based on **first 90-day behavior** (single vs. repeat, low vs. high value)
- Built a **CLV prediction model** using:
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Purchase Frequency (orders/month)
  - Estimated Lifespan (based on segment)
- Calculated **maximum allowable Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** using a 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio
- Validated model by comparing **predicted vs. actual CLV** for long-term customers

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- pandas
- pandasql (`sqldf`)
- Google Colab
- Excel (for output visualization)

## 📈 Key Takeaways

- SQL can be effectively used within Python notebooks using `pandasql`, combining the best of both worlds for analytics.
- Segmenting users by behavior within the first 90 days gives strong early signals of customer value.
- A CLV-driven acquisition model allows marketing teams to optimize ad spend and maximize ROI.
- Resurrection analysis identifies valuable win-back opportunities often overlooked in traditional retention metrics.
